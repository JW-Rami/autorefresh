## How to use it ?

1. Open your web page in your browser.

2. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the `auto_refresh.py` script is located

3. Run the script by typing `python auto_refresh.py` in your terminal or command prompt.

4. Go on the window where you want to auto refresh

5. The script will press the `Ctrl+R` keys every x seconds to refresh the web page.

## How to stop it ?

-> To stop the script from running, simply go back to the terminal or command prompt where the script is running and press `Ctrl+C` 2 times. This will send an interrupt signal to the script, and it will stop executing.
